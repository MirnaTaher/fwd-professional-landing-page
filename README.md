# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents
this project has 5 sections
it contains the following files:
index.html
styles.css
app.js

most of the modification are in the javascript file, and some edits to the css file and I added two sections to the end of the html file just to make it more clear that the nav menu works with variable numbers of sections.

the app.js file contains the following:
-some variables like sections htmlCollection and navbar list htmlCollection
-then we have some event listener, one for clicking on the navbar anchors and another one for scrolling
-and one helper function to see whether or not the section is in viewport

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
